      <h1>Chocolate Pancake</h1>

      <p>
        This is my go-to recipe for chocolate chip pancakes. The pancakes come
        out super fluffy and the whole family loves them. Add as many chocolate
        chips as you like. Can easily be doubled or tripled. Serve with maple
        syrup if you like.
      </p>

      <h2>Cook's Note</h2>
      <p>
        You can also sprinkle the chocolate chips on top once the pancakes are
        on the griddle instead of folding them into the batter - that way you
        can adjust the amount of chocolate chips per pancake. Instead of
        chocolate chips, you can add sprinkles, blueberries, or caramel chips as
        well.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ cup miniature chocolate chips, or more to taste</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Combine milk and vinegar in a bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to
          "sour" the milk. You are essentially making your own buttermilk with
          this step.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large
          mixing bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whisk egg, butter, and vanilla extract into "soured" milk until well
          combined. Pour flour mixture into the wet ingredients and whisk until
          just combined. Fold in chocolate chips. Batter will be thick. Allow
          batter to rest for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat, and coat with cooking
          spray.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour about ¼ cup of batter for each pancake onto the skillet. Cook
          until bubbles appear on the surface, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip pancake with
          a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 more
          minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately.
        </li>
