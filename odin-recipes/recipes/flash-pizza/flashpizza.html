        Cheesy, pepperoni-topped pizzas with a crispy, chewy crust. The homemade
        dough is inspired by the famous 2-ingredient pizza doughs, with just a
        few more ingredients to add better flavor, and it's ready to top and
        bake in just 10 minutes.

      <h2>Cook's Note</h2>
      <p>
        Like many people who are suckers for things that sound too good to be
        true, I eagerly tried "2-ingredient pizza dough" when it first went
        viral years ago. I knew it wasn't going to be anything close to real
        thin-crust pizza, and I was right. But, I did like how the tanginess of
        the yogurt simulated the fermented acidity of real, yeast-risen dough,
        and I decided to try and rework the basic idea to make it closer to the
        good stuff. Just not right away.
      </p>
      <p>
        I basically forgot about this very worthy quest for years, until seeing
        a friend tweet about "2-ingredient pizza dough" a few weeks ago. So, I
        started playing around, and I discovered that by adding just a few more
        ingredients, I could produce a dough that seemed much more pizza-like,
        but still only took about 10 minutes to mix up.
      </p>
      <p>
        The keys here are to make sure you roll your dough nice and thin, don't
        weigh it down with too much sauce and toppings, and most importantly,
        bake it until the bottom is well browned. If you can manage those
        things, you'll be enjoying something that even the biggest pizza snob
        will like. They won't admit it, but they will. Which is why I really do
        hope you give this a try soon.

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
          Mix 2 cups self-rising flour, sugar, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
          for dough in a bowl until well combined. Add olive oil and Greek
          yogurt and mix with a spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Clean off the
          spoon and mix the dough with your hands until it mostly comes
          together.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer dough to a work surface and continue pushing it together
          until it smooths out. It will be dry; don't be tempted yet to add more
          liquid. Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 3 to 4 minutes, only
          adding a teaspoon or two of water or flour if absolutely necessary.
          Cut dough into two equal pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
          Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and sprinkle 1
          tablespoon cornmeal over the surface.
        </li>
        <li>
          Roll one piece dough on a lightly floured surface to an 1/8-inch-thick
          rectangle. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Top dough with ½ of the pizza sauce, spreading it almost, but not
          quite all the way, to the edges. Sprinkle ½ of the mozzarella over the
          sauce, then ½ of the Parmigiano-Reggiano over top. Arrange ½ of the
          pepperoni slices over the cheese, then drizzle 1 teaspoon oil over
          top.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the center of the preheated oven until crust is beautifully
          browned and toppings are bubbly, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire
          rack and let sit for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
        </li>
        <li>
          As soon as you remove the pizza from the oven, repeat Steps 3 to 6 to
          top and bake second pizza.
        </li>
