        Cheesy, pepperoni-topped pizzas with a crispy, chewy crust. The homemade
        dough is inspired by the famous 2-ingredient pizza doughs, with just a
        few more ingredients to add better flavor, and it's ready to top and
        bake in just 10 minutes.

      <h2>Cook's Note</h2>
      <p>
        Like many people who are suckers for things that sound too good to be
        true, I eagerly tried "2-ingredient pizza dough" when it first went
        viral years ago. I knew it wasn't going to be anything close to real
        thin-crust pizza, and I was right. But, I did like how the tanginess of
        the yogurt simulated the fermented acidity of real, yeast-risen dough,
        and I decided to try and rework the basic idea to make it closer to the
        good stuff. Just not right away.

      <p>
        I basically forgot about this very worthy quest for years, until seeing
        a friend tweet about "2-ingredient pizza dough" a few weeks ago. So, I
        started playing around, and I discovered that by adding just a few more
        ingredients, I could produce a dough that seemed much more pizza-like,
        but still only took about 10 minutes to mix up.

        The keys here are to make sure you roll your dough nice and thin, don't
        weigh it down with too much sauce and toppings, and most importantly,
        bake it until the bottom is well browned. If you can manage those
        things, you'll be enjoying something that even the biggest pizza snob
        will like. They won't admit it, but they will. Which is why I really do
        hope you give this a try soon.
